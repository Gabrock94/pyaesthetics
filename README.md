Pyaesthetics (formlerly known as PrettyWebsite) is a python package designed to estimate visual features concerning the aesthetic appearance of a still image.

## Features
The module can estimate the following features:
- Brightness (in both the BT709 and BT601 standards)
- Contrast (RMS or Michelson contrast)
- Saturation
- Visual Complexity (either by using the weight of the image, by Quadratic Tree Decomposition, or by gradients)
- Simmetry (using Quadratic Tree Decomposition)
- Colorfulness (in both the HSV and RGB color spaces)
- Presence and number of human faces
- Color distribution (16 or 140 W3C colors, or no named colors)
- Number of images within the image
- Surface of visual and textual areas within the image
- Ratio between visual and textual areas
- Ratio between straight and curved lines
- Anisotropy
- Self-similarity (using either the ground, parent, or neighbors method)

## Installation
pyaesthetics can be installed using pip:
```bash
pip install pyaesthetics
```

### Tesseract and pytesseract
Tesseract and pytesseract are also required. 
To install tesseract please visit: https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Installation.html

### Updating the package
To update the package via pip, you can use:
```bash
pip install --user --upgrade pyaesthetics
```

## Example
pyaeshtetics modules can be used one at the time to estimate one specific feature, or they can be automatically called using an automated entrypoint that calls all the available modules at once. 

### Example 1: one single feature (e.g. Brigthness BT601)

```python
#load only the neede functions from the specific module
from pyaesthetics.brightness import relativeluminance_bt601
from pyaeshtetics.utils import sRGB2RGB
import cv2 #to open and handle images

#define the path to a sample image
path_to_img = "/path/to/image/image.jpg"

#load the image
img = cv2.imread(path_to_img)

#convert the image to the RGB colorscheme
img = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
img = sRGB2RGB(img)
print(relativeluminance_bt601(img))

```
### Example 2: Complete analysis

```python
import pyaesthetics

#define the path to a sample image
path_to_img = "/path/to/image/image.jpg"

#perform a subset of the analysis using standard parameters
results = pyaesthetics.analysis.analyze_image(path_to_img, method="fast")
print(results)

```
Or for a faster analysis:

```python
import pyaesthetics

#define the path to a sample image
path_to_img = "/path/to/image/image.jpg"

#perform a subset of the analysis using standard parameters
results = pyaesthetics.analysis.analyze_image(path_to_img, method="complete")
print(results)
```

## Documentation
The updated documentation of pyaesthetics, its modules, as well as a getting started guide and a list of examples can be found on [Read the Docs](https://prettywebsite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The documentation of each release version of pyaesthetics can be accessed separately through the drop-down menu at the bottom of the left sidebar. 

## Requirements
In order to work correctly, pyaesthetics requires the installation of the following packages.

- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- pandas
- opencv-python
- imutils
- pytesseract
- pillow
- scikit-image
