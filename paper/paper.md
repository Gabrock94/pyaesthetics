# Summary

The growing amount of research in neuroaesthetics, an interdisciplinary field exploring the neural basis of aesthetic experiences and preferences, particularly concerning the aesthetics of visual stimuli, highlights the interest of researchers in the complex interplay between sensory perception and emotional response. Despite the volume of research, the number of features analyzed by each study is generally limited to a small subset of visual properties. This lack of interest in multiple and more complex features can be partly explained by the absence of tools that allow for the efficient estimation of a wide range of features from images, making the process very time-consuming and leading to significant challenges in result reproducibility, as variations in implementation and feature estimation occur. The pyaesthetics package is designed to streamline and simplify the feature estimation process by providing access to a multitude of functions that can be used to extract the most commonly analyzed visual features.

# Statement of need

`pyaesthetics` is an Astropy-affiliated Python package for galactic dynamics. Python
enables wrapping low-level languages (e.g., C) for speed without losing
flexibility or ease-of-use in the user-interface. The API for `Gala` was
designed to provide a class-based and user-friendly interface to fast (C or
Cython-optimized) implementations of common operations such as gravitational
potential and force evaluation, orbit integration, dynamical transformations,
and chaos indicators for nonlinear dynamics. `Gala` also relies heavily on and
interfaces well with the implementations of physical units and astronomical
coordinate systems in the `Astropy` package [@astropy] (`astropy.units` and
`astropy.coordinates`).

`Gala` was designed to be used by both astronomical researchers and by
students in courses on gravitational dynamics or astronomy. It has already been
used in a number of scientific publications [@Pearson:2017] and has also been
used in graduate courses on Galactic dynamics to, e.g., provide interactive
visualizations of textbook material [@Binney:2008]. The combination of speed,
design, and support for Astropy functionality in `Gala` will enable exciting
scientific explorations of forthcoming data releases from the *Gaia* mission
[@gaia] by students and experts alike.

# Figures

Figures can be included like this:
![Caption for example figure.\label{fig:example}](figure.png)
and referenced from text using \autoref{fig:example}.

Figure sizes can be customized by adding an optional second parameter:
![Caption for example figure.](figure.png){ width=20% }
