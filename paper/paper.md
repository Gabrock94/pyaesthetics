# Summary

Empirical aesthetics is an interdisciplinary research field that seeks to understand how individuals experience, evaluate, and create aesthetically pleasing objects by integrating insights from psychology, neuroscience, and aesthetics. The primary focus of empirical aesthetics is on visual and auditory stimuli, with particular emphasis on beauty and artistic expression.

Despite the growing body of research on visual empirical aesthetics, many studies analyze only a limited subset of visual properties. This narrow focus can be partly attributed to the lack of tools capable of efficiently estimating a wide range of visual features from images. Existing methods for estimating visual features often suffer from variations in implementation, posing significant challenges to result reproducibility. The `pyaesthetics` package addresses these issues by streamlining and simplifying the feature estimation process, offering access to a wide range of functions for analyzing visual properties.

# Statement of Need

`pyaesthetics` is a Python package designed for estimating visual features from still images. It addresses the scarcity of free, open-source, and user-friendly tools for evaluating a broad range of visual features. The `pyaesthetics` API provides modules for analyzing various visual properties commonly used in empirical aesthetics research. It also includes simple entry points for automated analysis, making it accessible to users with limited coding experience.

The package supports the estimation of features such as brightness, contrast, saturation, visual complexity, symmetry, colorfulness, and color distribution. It allows users to extract single or multiple features simultaneously from images. For features that benefit from visual interpretation (e.g., visual complexity using quadratic tree decomposition), the package includes plotting utilities. For example, Figure 1 demonstrates how the quadratic tree decomposition method visualizes visual complexity. Each square in the decomposition tree represents a leaf, with the total number of leaves indicating the image's visual complexity; a higher leaf count corresponds to greater complexity. This visualization helps identify which parts of the image contribute most to overall complexity.

The image depicts the analysis of visual complexity, estimated via quadratic tree decomposition, of a still image from the AVI14 dataset [@miniukovich2014quantification]. Each square represents a leaf of the decomposition tree, with the total number of leaves providing a measure of visual complexity; a higher number of leaves indicates greater visual complexity. The visual representation helps in understanding which parts of the image contribute most to the overall visual complexity.](QTDsample.png){ width=100% }

The primary audience for `pyaesthetics` is researchers in empirical aesthetics. However, its modules are also valuable for researchers in social sciences, particularly psychology and neuroscience, for exploring the visual properties of stimuli used in experiments (e.g., matching the brightness of visual images). Additionally, the package may serve visual designers, artists, and others who need to analyze visual properties in diverse image contexts (e.g., extracting color palettes, as shown in Figure 2).

`pyaesthetics` is distributed under the GNU General Public License (Version 3). The source code is available in a [public Git repository](https://github.com/Gabrock94/pyaesthetics), and the [documentation](https://prettywebsite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is hosted on Read the Docs. The documentation includes installation instructions, a getting-started guide, and examples of potential applications.

# Ease of Use

To encourage widespread adoption, `pyaesthetics` provides an automated module for estimating all available features. This module simplifies the integration of the package into research workflows, even for users with minimal programming experience. It includes functions for comprehensive analysis with default parameters tailored to diverse applications.

Below is an example of how to use the automated analysis module:

```python
import pyaesthetics

# Define the path to a sample image
path_to_img = "/path/to/image/image.jpg"

# Perform a subset of the analysis using standard parameters
results = pyaesthetics.analysis.analyze_image(path_to_img, method="complete")
```

# Use in Scientific Publications

The pyaesthetics package has been featured in several peer-reviewed scientific publications and theses. For example, it was used by @bizzego2022dataset and @liu2024mothers to verify the consistency of visual complexity across trials involving different visual stimuli. It was employed by @gabrieli2023machine to examine the influence of various visual features on aesthetic judgments of websites, by @cianfanelli2023binding to analyze the visual complexity of IAPS images, by @music2023beautification to study the contribution of visual features to the perception of beauty in images, and by @Veldhuizen2024 to investigate the impact of aesthetic features on consumer judgments of packaging labels.
